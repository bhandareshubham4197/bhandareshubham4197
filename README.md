## Hi there 👋

Hey there!
I’m Shubham, a data analyst based in [your location].

I dive deep into data to uncover insights and turn numbers into stories.

If a dataset catches my eye, chances are I’ll analyze it, visualize it, and make it actionable.

My main tech stack includes Python, SQL, and Tableau, with a love for pandas, matplotlib, and Power BI. My favorite tools are Jupyter Notebook, Excel, and Notion for keeping everything organized.
